Collections Framework:
    Collections framework is a collection of multiple classes and interfaces which help us process
    the data efficiently and easily
Why we should learn about it?
    1) it's very flexible
    2)provide ready-made methods that we can just use.
What is the syntax?
    It's similar to hoe we create the object of any class, but we use <> to specify the name of the class whose object
    we are going to store in that class.
Issues with Collections framework:
    1) Collection framework does not work with primitive datatypes(Solution is use a wrapper classes)

NOTE: REQUENTLY ASKED IN INTERVIEWS!!!!!!!
Wrapper Classes:
    wrapper classes are object types for all primitive types
Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by explicitly calling methods.
            int num=10;
            //boxing or manual conversion from primitive to wrapper type
            //Integer wrappedNum=Integer.valueof(num);
            //Now called AutoBoxing or automatic conversion of a primitive to a wrapper type
Auto Boxing:
    converting the primitive data type to its corresponding wrapper type by simply assigning the values.
            Integer wrappedNum=10;

Unboxing:
    Converting a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive type to by explicitly calling method
            //unboxing convverting a wrapper type to a corresponding primitive type
            //int num2=wrappedNum.intValue();
Auto Boxing:
    converting a wrapper to corresponding primitive automatically by just assigning the value
            Integer wrappedNUm=new Integer(10);
            int num2=wrappedNum;
